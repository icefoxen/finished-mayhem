mc is a Mayhem compiler.
It compiles Mayhem to C.
This means you can run it about anywhere, which is hot.

I want:
Exceptions
Tail-call opt and iteration
Better structure and array syntax...
Packages

docstrings ("docstring!" defun foo ...)
operators would be NICE...
varargs/named args
objects (or TYPECLASSES!)
optional types

Tuples/algebraic data types
Pattern matching




!arr idx
:struct var
var <- newval ; Hmmm, assignment...  Hmmm, objects...

But, nesting, dammit!



Nifty dev environment that can integrate with different editors
